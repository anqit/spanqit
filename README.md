# spanqit

***
## Exciting update!
Spanqit has been merged into the Eclipse Foundation project [rdf4j](http://rdf4j.org/)! As such, further development will continue there first, and perhaps backported here. Check out links to [docs](https://rdf4j.org/documentation/tutorials/sparqlbuilder/) and the [source code](https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/tree/main/core/sparqlbuilder)

A Java-based SPARQL query generator

Spanqit is an open source, fluent Java library to programatically create SPARQL queries. See the [wiki](https://github.com/anqit/spanqit/wiki) and javadocs (coming soon) for more info.


### New with version 1.1:
- Support for all of the [Update Queries](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-update/)!!
- No more need for adapters, all RDF elements can be created from with Spanqit, including IRI's and blank nodes
- support for more SPARQL syntax constructs like predicate-object lists in triple patterns and blank nodes
- more convenience methods
- some bug fixes and javadocs
Check out the updated [examples project](https://github.com/anqit/spanqit-examples) for detailed usage
